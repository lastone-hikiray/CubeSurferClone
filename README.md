I'll start with a description of the level:
![](Images/1.png)

The entire level consists of only 3 components.

The Road.

The Walls.

And cubes that we can collect.

I optimized the walls a little, making them prefabs, and combining the colliders of all cubes.

Also, there is a bezier curve at the level indicating the direction.
